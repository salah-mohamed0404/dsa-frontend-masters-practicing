# Complete Intro to Computer Science (v2) — Practice (TypeScript + TDD)

Practice for the Frontend Masters course:
https://frontendmasters.com/courses/computer-science-v2/

This folder contains my TypeScript implementations + Vitest tests for the exercises covered in the course, built with a TDD workflow (write tests → make them pass → refactor).

## Running locally

From the repo root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test
pnpm test:watch
```

## Folder structure

Each exercise typically includes:

- `README.md` (notes + complexity)
- implementation (`*.ts`)
- tests (`*.test.ts`)
