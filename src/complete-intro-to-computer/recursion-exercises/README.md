# Recursion

## Explanation

An alternative to iteration that can be clearer for self-similar problems.
Splitting the problem into smaller problems till we don't have to solve any (hit the simplest form of our problem that we have its solution directly).
By creating function that do some operations and return itself with smaller problem till we reach a base case.
